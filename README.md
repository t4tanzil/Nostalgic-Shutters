**Nostalgic Shutters** is a website dedicated to vintage photography enthusiasts, offering a curated selection of Polaroid cameras, SLR cameras, disposable cameras, and film rolls. This project was created as part of my 1st semester coursework at Georgian College, in collaboration with my classmate Parth Baweja. Together, we designed and developed the website to showcase our skills in web development and creativity.
